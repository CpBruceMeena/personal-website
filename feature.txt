# Portfolio Formatting Changes - Work Experience Section

## Issues Identified

Comparing the Internships and Work Experience sections, the following formatting inconsistencies were found:

### 1. Card Container Styling
- **Current Issue**: Work Experience section has sharp/square corners
- **Required Change**: Apply rounded corners to match Internships section styling

### 2. Spacing and Layout
- **Current Issue**: Different spacing between company entries and inconsistent padding
- **Required Change**: Match the spacing used in Internships section

### 3. Content Container
- **Current Issue**: Work Experience entries appear to have different background styling
- **Required Change**: Apply consistent background and border styling

## Specific CSS/Styling Changes Required

### For Work Experience Section Container:
```css
/* Apply same styling as Internships section */
.work-experience-container {
    border-radius: 12px; /* Match curved corners */
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05); /* Match background opacity */
    padding: 24px; /* Match padding */
    margin-bottom: 32px; /* Match margin spacing */
}
```

### For Individual Experience Cards:
```css
.experience-card {
    margin-bottom: 48px; /* Match spacing between entries */
    padding: 20px; /* Consistent internal padding */
}

.experience-card:last-child {
    margin-bottom: 0; /* Remove bottom margin from last item */
}
```

### For Company Logo/Icon Container:
```css
.company-logo-container {
    border-radius: 8px; /* Match rounded corners for logo containers */
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); /* Consistent background */
    padding: 12px; /* Match padding */
}
```

## Visual Consistency Checklist

- [ ] Apply rounded corners (border-radius: 12px) to main Work Experience container
- [ ] Ensure consistent spacing between INDMONEY and Angel One entries (48px margin-bottom)
- [ ] Match the background styling and opacity used in Internships section
- [ ] Verify padding consistency within each experience entry
- [ ] Ensure company logo containers have rounded corners
- [ ] Check that the overall section follows the same visual hierarchy as Internships

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Container rounded corners and background styling
2. **Medium Priority**: Spacing consistency between entries
3. **Low Priority**: Fine-tuning padding and margin adjustments

## Testing Notes

After implementing changes:
- Compare side-by-side with Internships section
- Verify responsive behavior matches
- Check that visual hierarchy remains consistent
- Ensure readability is maintained across different screen sizes
